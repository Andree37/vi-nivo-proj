1. Node.js
2. Yarn
3. Code Editor (Visual Studio Code)
4. Pre-prepared project (dataset included)

#### 1. Installing Node.js

We will require Node.js 14.16 LTS or higher. The windows version can be downloaded from [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Just run the file and follow the instructions.

You check if the installation was successfull by running the following command:

```batch
node --version
```

Result: 
> v14.16.0

#### 2. Installing Yarn

With the Node.js installed open the command line and execute the following command:

```batch
npm install -g yarn
```

And check the installation by running:

```batch
yarn --version
```

Result:
> 1.22.10

#### 3. Code Editor: Installing Visual Studio Code

We use Visual Studio Code. But any other editor and command line will do the job.

You can download the VSCode installation file from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

After successfull download just follow the installation download.

#### 4. Downloading pre-prepared project

After installing all software, download the project from [here](https://github.com/Andree37/vi-nivo-proj/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it to a local folder.

#### 5. Install project dependencies

Once you've downloaded the project you will finally need to install the project dependencies. Just open the project folder with Visual Studio Code (or other editor of your choice) and type in a command line:

```batch
yarn install
```

A large set of packages will be installed and afterwards you're good to go.
